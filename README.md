## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (for version control)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayushgoyal04/django-travel-companion-app.git
   cd django-travel-companion-app

2. **Clone the repository**
   Itâ€™s a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project. This ensures that dependencies are isolated and won't conflict with other Python projects on your system.
-  MacOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Activating the virtual environment
- Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Activating the virtual environment

3. **Install dependencies**
   After activating the virtual environment, install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Apply migrations**
   Now that the dependencies are installed, apply the database migrations to set up your database:
python manage.py migrate

5. **Create a superuser (for accessing the Django admin panel)**
Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface, where you can manage trips and notes:
python manage.py createsuperuser

6. **Run the development server**
   You are now ready to run the application! Start the Django development server:
python manage.py runserver
